Welcome to the website of the "Laborstunden Komposition" Course.

This course serves as an introduction to music composition focused on contemporary techniques. The aim is not only to learn about specific techniques but also to develop a personal creative impulse. For this reason, most of the exercises will have a practical approach. The exercises will help to learn how to initiate and create musical ideas and elaborate them into musical compositions.

The website will contain materials of the seminars, exercises, assignments and upcoming events of the class (such as workshops, guest lectures etc), to which you can easily access using the sections above. The materials of the lectures will be added sequentially right after every lesson.
